// What is method overloading ?
// -> Method overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name
//    within the same class but different parameter lists or return types. This allows for
//    multiple ways to perform the same task with different inputs or outputs.

// What is method overriding ?
// -> Method overriding refers to the ability of a derived class to provide a
//    specific(can be same(rarely) or different(most of the time)) implementation for a function
//    that has already been defined in its base class. This allows objects of the derived class
//    to use their own version of the function rather than the one defined in the base class.
//    Always remember, methods overriden in base class should be the same in terms of
//    function signature(name, return type, and parameters) of base class.
//    Note that, if a particular function has been inherited in derived class, there is no point
//    of overriding method with same body. Its unnecessary writing of same function reduntantly.
//    Overriding method with same body is useful if that function couldn't be inherited in
//    derived class(this happens if a function is private in base class).
