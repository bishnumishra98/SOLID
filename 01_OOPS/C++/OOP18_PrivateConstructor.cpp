// In C++, a private constructor is possible. Declaring a constructor as private means that the
// constructor can only be accessed or called within the class itself, and it cannot be accessed
// from outside the class or by other classes. This can be useful in various design patterns, such
// as the Singleton pattern, where you want to ensure that only one instance of a class is created,
// or in cases when we want an object to be made only from a class's friend class.

// Constructor of Box class is made private. Thus, no objects of Box class can be made directly.
// To make objects of Box class, the programmer must use its friend class BoxFactory. One use case
// for this is to keep a count of the number of boxes made from the Box class.
