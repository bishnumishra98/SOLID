// A constructor is a special member function of a class that is automatically called each time 
// an object of the class is created. The purpose of a constructor is to initialize the
// object's data members and set up the object's initial state.

// Properties of constructors are:
// 1) Constructor is an instance member function of class. It can never be static.
// 2) The name of constructor must be the same as the class name.
// 3) It has no return type.
// 4) Constructors must be placed in public section of class. In special cases, constructors can
//    be kept in private section of class about which we will learn later.
// 5) If we do not specify a constructor, C++ compiler generates a default constructor for object
//    which expects no parameter and has an empty body. A default constructor initializes
//    instance variables with garbage values.


// Q) If compiler generates a default constructor automatically for each object, why the
//    programmer should explicitly define constructors in class ?

// A) While the C++ compiler does generate a default constructor automatically if none is defined,
//    there are several reasons why a programmer might choose to explicitly define constructors:

//    1) Initialization with Specific Values:
//       When a programmer defines a constructor, they can provide specific initial values for the
//       object's member variables. This allows for controlled and meaningful initialization.

//    2) Custom Initialization Logic:
//       Constructors allow the programmer to include custom logic for initializing the object,
//       especially if the initialization process is more complex than simple assignments.

//    3) Initialization of Dynamic Resources:
//       If a class manages dynamic resources (memory, file handles, network connections, etc.),
//       a custom constructor allows for the allocation and proper initialization of those resources.

//    4) Overloading Constructors:
//       Overloading constructors allows a class to have multiple ways of being instantiated,
//       providing flexibility to the programmer when creating objects.
