    // Solution 2) By using virtual classes.
    obj.walk();   // Here, obj.walk() means Person::walk() because the virtual keyword is used
                 // for both Teacher and Researcher classes during inheritance from Person.

    // How virtual keyword works here?
    // When there was no virtual keyword, the compiler made two separate copies of Person::walk(),
    // one for Teacher and the other for Researcher at compile time (also called early binding).
    // Now, by using virtual inheritance, the compiler ensures that there is only one shared
    // instance of Person::walk() within the Engineer object at runtime. The virtual table (vtable)
    // is used to resolve the function call dynamically (also called late binding), allowing
    // Engineer obj to invoke walk() of the shared Person class directly.
